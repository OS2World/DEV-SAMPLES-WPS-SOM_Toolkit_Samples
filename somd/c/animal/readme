NOTE:  Please review the README file in %SOMBASE%\samples for general 
       information on setting up and running DSOM samples.  This README 
       assumes that information. 
 
Sample summary 
-------------- 
This directory contains the source for a simple generic server which uses 
the SOM Object Adapter to automatically load class libraries and execute 
requests on objects instantiated in the server.  The server will loop 
forever processing requests from clients.  The directory also contains a 
sample client program which uses static bindings to invoke methods on 
remote objects.  The client program creates several remote animals, sets 
the instance data for the animals, displays the instance data, invokes 
other remote methods and destroys the local proxy objects and remote 
animal objects. 
 
Making the sample 
----------------- 
BEFORE making the sample, the DSOM daemon "somdd" must be running (either 
in the background or in a separate OS/2 command window) and the Name Service 
must have been configured using som_cfg, as described in the README file in 
%SOMBASE%\samples.  This is because the makefile for the sample 
registers the servers and classes in the Name Service. 
 
The makefile in this directory will build a client executable, a server 
executable and a dynamically loadable library.  They are: 
 
 - testsvr.exe (the generic server) 
 
 - anitest.exe (the DSOM client application) 
 
 - danimal.dll (the library loaded by testsvr) 
 
Entering "nmake" will not only build the above but it will also 
build the interface and implementation repositories that the 
servers will utilize. 
 
Running the sample 
------------------ 
Before running the sample, remember to start the DSOM daemon "somdd" in this 
directory. If the daemon is currently running you must first kill it and 
restart it in this directory.  This is because the daemon "somdd" will 
start the sample server "testsvr" which will attempt to load the danimal dll. 
The danimal dll needs to reside in the LIBPATH of the sample server. 
 
To start the daemon, enter: 
 
   start /c /f somdd 
and wait for it to issue the "SOMDD - Ready" message. 
 
Once the daemon is started, entering "anitest" from the command line will 
run the sample.  The server will be started automatically and the results 
will be displayed to standard output. 
 
You may also start the server yourself by entering "start testsvr -a aniServer1" 
from the command line.  Note that "aniServer1" is the server alias name 
specified in the makefile when calling the Implementation Repository  
registration utility, regimpl. 
 
Cleaning up the sample 
---------------------- 
BEFORE cleaning up the sample, the DSOM daemon "somdd" must be running (either 
in the background or in a separate OS/2 command window).  This is because the  
makefile for the sample deregisters the servers and classes in the Name Service. 
 
Terminate all the instances of somdsvr and testsvr.  This is because the servers  
will have the som.ir and dlls locked so they can't be erased.  To clean up the  
sample, enter "nmake clean".  This will delete all non-source files and deregister 
itself from the Name Service and Implementation Repository. 
 
The daemon "somdd" will restart the naming server to deregister the sample.
