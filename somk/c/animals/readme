This sample program illustrates some fundamental aspects of SOM,
such as the use of inheritance, modules, classes, and metaclasses.
The M_Animal metaclass shows how to use a metaclass to keep track
of object instances.  The metaclasses in this program also illustrate
how constructors can be defined for creating objects.

Run "nmake" to build the sample executable named "animals.exe".

Run "nmake clean" to clean up the directory after you are finished with the
sample.
