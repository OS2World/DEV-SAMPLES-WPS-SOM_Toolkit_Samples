This sample program (tp) illustrates the use of SOM in a simple
text-processing application.  The classes in this sample make 
use of the callstyle=oidl modifier.  This callstyle suppresses the
use of the CORBA Environment parameter as an implicit second argument
for each method.  This example also illustrates the use of attributes
including those with and without modifiers (such as "noset", "nodata",
etc.).

Run "nmake" to build the sample executable named "tp.exe".

Run "nmake clean" to clean up the directory after you are finished with the
sample.
